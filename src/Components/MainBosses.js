                    Once the Taurus Demon spawns, run back and climb the tower – drop down and slash him for a nice damage boost. Alternatively, you can get very close to him and hope that he jumps off the bridge by himself.</p>

                    If you are having trouble beating the Bell Gargoyles, you can use Humanity to become human and summon Solaire before the fight to help you. This will make the fight much easier.

                    <p>The Capra Demon is completely optional, and quite a frustrating boss to fight early on in the game.
<br></br>
Once you traverse through the fog you will be greeted with 2 poison dogs, and the boss charging at you. The problem? You are in a tiny room which makes it extremely difficult to run or fight properly.
<br></br>
Your best bet is to try to run on the left side and up the stairs. From there you can take care of the poison dogs before focusing on the boss.
<br></br>
There is a cheap way to beat the Capra Demon, and that is by throwing a bunch of Dung Pies over the wall before traversing through the fog</p>

                    The Moonlight Butterfly is one of the easiest Dark Souls bosses to fight. You can become human using Humanity and summon Beatrice and she can shoot the boss for you if you are playing a melee class.
                    <br></br>
                    Once the Moonlight Butterfly lands, just smack it a few times with your weapon of choice to defeat it.

                    The Gaping Dragon is also optional if you selected the Master Key at the start of the game, however, he is relatively easy to beat and gives you 20,000 souls.
                    <br></br>
                    For this boss, you can summon Solaire and Lautrec (his summoning stone is hidden behind the pillar by the last staircase) which should make this battle easy. Be sure to avoid his deadly grip though, that attack hurts a lot and can catch you by surprise.
                    <br></br>
                    Once killed, you will get the Blighttown Key and if you took out his tail you will get the Dragon King Greataxe as well.

                    Of all Dark Souls bosses, the Stray Demon is just a reskin of the Asylum Demon you faced early on in the game. He is basically just a tougher Asylum Demon that you should have no problem killing.
                    <br></br>
                    If you want an easy kill, stay out of his range and throw Dung at him. This should bring him to about 25% HP if you wait long enough. Alternatively, you can use a weapon that causes bleeding such as the Bandit’s Knife for an easy kill.

                    Defeating the Great Grey Wolf Sif is essential as you need to collect the Covenant of Artorias for a later stage in the game.
                    <br></br>
                    To reach Sif you must first purchase the Crest of Artorias from the first blacksmith you encounter (Andre of Astora) for 20,000 souls. Alternatively you can reach him by using the ladder at the Hydra mini boss battle.

                    The Hydra sit below a ladder in Darkroot Basin and will shoot at you from time to time. To defeat the Hydra, you just need to keep avoiding it and wait until it drop’s a head on the ground. Hit the heads with all you got to chop them off.

                    What makes the Iron Golem one of the easiest bosses in Dark Souls is that if you are in human form, you can summon a companion to help you, and the companion can take down the Iron Golem solo, without your help. You should have no problems defeating this Dark Souls boss.

                    Priscilla is one of the optional Dark Souls bosses that will only attack you if you attack her first. Chopping off her tail with giving you Priscilla’s Dagger which afflicts bleed damage.
                    <br></br>
                    There are 2 phases to this battle but you must be sure to stay fully healed during phase 1. Phase 2 is considerably easier to do, however, Priscilla will swap between phases more than once if you don’t kill her quick enough.
                    <br></br>
                    If you have fire attacks, use them. Priscilla is weak against fire and will go down pretty quickly. Alternatively, use throwing knives to unstealth her.

                    These 2 bosses can be incredibly difficult to kill, and depending on who you kill last will determine your reward. Killing Ornstein (the small guy) first is the easier path to take, but killing Smough (the big guy) first will grant you a better reward.
                    <br></br>
                    It is highly recommended you summon Solaire in to this battle as that will help a lot with tanking one enemy.
                    <br></br>
                    Avoid using lightning attacks, as it won’t help at all, however, fire attacks can be very beneficial.

                    Gwyndolin is quite a confusing boss to deal with. You will find yourself just running and if you reach him quickly enough, you can do some damage.
                    <br></br>
                    The goal with defeating Gwyndolin is to get close whilst avoiding his attacks, then hitting him as you charge towards him. Rinse and repeat this until he is dead.
                    <br></br>
                    Easy kill: Shoot Gwyndolin with a ranged attack from 2 pillars away whilst avoiding his attacks.

                    Artoria the Abysswalker is a melee fighter that is super quick, but easy to dodge. Be sure to be light on your feet as you will need to dodge Artorias’ attacks frequently.
                    <br></br>
                    Use a weapon with a long reach, such as a Halbert to take care of the job. Artorias should not give you too much trouble if you are light-footed.
